      "Radha’s research has uncovered novel cell death mechanisms and previously unidentified intracellular targets of drug molecules. In one study, she demonstrated that shikonin (SK), a hydroxy-naphthoquinone, induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative breast cancer) cells and necroptosis in HT29 (colorectal cancer) cells, underscoring its ability to engage cell-specific death pathways. Using sorafenib (SF) as a molecular probe, she revealed a unique mode of cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells involving concurrent activation of apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. Both SK and SF disrupted tubulin and microtubule dynamics, suggesting a common mechanism underpinning their cytotoxic effects. However, their combined treatment did not result in synergistic activity, instead showing moderate antagonism to near-additive effects across tested concentrations. These findings enhance our understanding of non-apoptotic cell death and offer valuable insight for designing therapies aimed at overcoming drug resistance in cancer",

    <p><strong>Enhancing treatment efficacy via strategic drug formulation against cancer</strong><p> </br>
    One of the major challenges in cancer therapy is off-target toxicity arising from
the high doses of chemotherapeutic drugs required to achieve therapeutic
efficacy. Compounding this issue, cancer cells frequently develop resistance to
apoptosis—the primary mode of action for most anticancer drugs currently
available. Garima’s research addresses these limitations by investigating the
potential of strategically designed drug formulations to induce alternative, non-
apoptotic modes of cell death in cancer cells, alongside exploring efficient
delivery mechanisms for these therapeutic agents. Her work centers on
elucidating non-apoptotic cell death pathways such as autophagy, necroptosis,
pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, and evaluating the possible synergistic interactions
among drug molecules capable of triggering these mechanisms. The study
involves comprehensive cellular-level analyses, including assessments of cell
viability, clonogenic potential, migration, cell cycle dynamics, and cell death
profiles. Advanced methodologies—such as immunofluorescence-based super-
resolution microscopy and electron microscopy—are employed to investigate
cellular ultrastructure and subcellular alterations. In parallel, proteomics and
western blotting techniques are utilized to unravel the molecular mechanisms
underlying the observed biological responses. Additionally, the development of
targeted nanocarrier systems is underway to facilitate precise and efficient
delivery of the formulations, thereby enhancing therapeutic selectivity and
minimizing systemic toxicity.

    <p><strong>Designer nanoparticles to augment optothermal and radiation therapies for cancer</strong><p> </br>
Cancer remains a major health challenge due to uncontrolled cell growth and functional
abnormalities. While chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective, they often damage
healthy tissue because of poor selectivity. This highlights the need for therapies that
precisely target cancer cells. A promising solution involves combining nanotechnology
with treatments like photothermal therapy (PTT) and ionizing radiation. Gold
nanoparticles (AuNPs) are particularly suited for this due to their ability to
preferentially accumulate in tumors (via the EPR effect), their customizable surfaces,
and unique optical properties. Functionalizing AuNPs with plant-based anticancer
agents enhances their efficacy. These nanoparticles convert near-infrared light into heat,
selectively damaging tumor tissue through hyperthermia. Their high atomic number
also boosts radiation-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering
oxidative stress and apoptosis. Inside cancer cells, AuNPs disrupt intracellular
machinery and amplify DNA damage under radiation and heat, overwhelming cancer
cells&#39; limited repair capacity. This targeted approach spares healthy cells and shows
strong potential as a precise, multimodal therapy for cancer.

<p><strong>Anticancer properties and mechanistic insights into the modes of action of ayurevidc
phytochemicals-functionalized gold nanoparticles.</strong><p> </br>

    Dr. Kimaya’s research focused on the development of three gold nanoparticle (GNP)
formulations derived from potent medicinal plants—ashwagandha (Ws-GNPs), garlic (As-
GNPs), and brahmi (Bm-GNPs)—and their antiproliferative efficacy against triple-negative
breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). The nucleophilic nature of the phytochemicals enabled
the reduction of the gold precursor and facilitated their collective functionalization onto the
nanoparticles. This functionalization imparted stability against aggregation and enabled the
co-delivery of plant-derived phytochemicals to target cells. The nanoparticles were
synthesized using aqueous extracts of the plants and gold(III) chloride trihydrate, and
characterized through a suite of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Ws-GNPs and As-
GNPs predominantly exhibited spherical morphology, while Bm-GNPs displayed polygonal
shapes. The particles, with an average core diameter ranging from 20 to 30 nm, demonstrated
stability against aggregation. Characterization using NMR, FTIR, and LC-MS confirmed
successful surface functionalization with the respective phytochemicals.Biological evaluation
indicated superior efficacy of the nanoparticles in reducing the proliferative potential of
cancer cells compared to the crude plant extracts, a result attributed to the efficient
internalization of GNPs. One of the identified intracellular targets was tubulin; the
nanoparticles disrupted its structural integrity, thereby compromising the stability of
microtubule filaments. Additionally, the GNPs were capable of inducing multiple modes of
cell death, underscoring their potential as multifaceted anti-cancer agents.`,
