      "One of the prevalent features of cancer cells is their resistance to natural or drug-induced apoptosis. Although several alternate cell death mechanisms have been identified, the biology of these non-apoptotic cell death mechanisms is not yet fully comprehended.",
      "Understanding the molecular details of these mechanisms would help identify potential inducers that can kill cancer cells that are resistant to apoptosis.",
